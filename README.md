# MAGENTA: A Framework for LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Autoformalizaton
## Overview
MAGENTA provides support for designing and implementing the components that are typically involved in establishing a multi-agent autoformalization system. The components involved in the system include **Agent**, **Large Language Model (LLM)**, **Knowledge Base (KB)**, **Retriever** and **Theorem Prover (TP)**. We illustrate our system in the figure below.
